    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <div class="container">
      <p>I am a 19 year old student from Indiana who enjoys running, weight lifting, traveling, and rock climbing. Additionally, I am a current member of the Alpha Sigma Phi fraternity. I'm studying Business and Information Technology at IIT. My parents have owned multiple restaurants for much of my life which I have worked at since highschool; because of this I found my interest in restaurant consulting. After graduation I hope to pursue a career in restaurant consulting to help small businesses integrate technology and marketing to improve profit.</p>

While I struggled with it at first I quickly picked up and glad that I had the opportunity to go. Since the semester started I have moved into fraternity housing where I have enjoyed my experience greatly compared to the school's dorms.</p>
